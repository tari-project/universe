🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.909 “RC1” — The Surge of Soon

_April 29, 2025_

Hey fam 👋,
We’re excited to drop the BIGGEST update we’ve ever released 💥

Introducing “The Surge of Soon”, the first release candidate of Tari Universe (v0.9.90x).

This release is a huge step forward. One of the biggest pieces of feedback we hear from the Tari community is about the pain of startup and initialization. Until now, there have been three major frustrations:

- 1️⃣ You can’t access settings, sign into airdrop, or do anything else while the app is starting up
- 2️⃣ It can take up to 3 hours for a new user to begin mining
- 3️⃣ Many community members can’t get the app to load at all due to startup-related errors

The Surge of Soon tackles these mission-critical issues head-on. You can now access Settings ⚙️ and sign into Airdrop 🎁 while the app is loading. And VERY SOON all Tari Universe users will now be able to go from launching the app to mining in 120 seconds or less 🏎️🏁

# 🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.805: The Great Pool War, Episode 3

_February 17, 2025_

Dear Community,

As the great pool war enters its 3rd phase, p2pool has maintained its ~80%+ win rate per 24 hours, rising to 90% for those mining for more than six hours. We are (largely) winning fam. Even if you're on the lower end of the hash rate spectrum (e.g., <1000 h/s CPU), each winning share can continue paying out for up to 12 hours—so keep the mining party rolling!

## ✨ What's New

- 🛠 **Resolved app load sequence freezes.**  
- 🎭 **Animation fixes** improved reliability of state transitions.  
- ⚠️ **Airdrop login button failures** traced to unsupported Ubuntu versions and missing OS dependencies.  
  - ✅ **Minimum Ubuntu version: 22**  
  - 📝 We're working on a more robust Linux FAQ since most issues stem from OS flavor/version mismatches. 

## **Coming Soon**

- ⚖️ More P2Pool fixes for lower hash power levels
- ⚙️ Restorationof persistent window settings
- 🖥️ Enhanced GPU support, monitoring, and reporting
- 📋 Roadmap for older OS and GPU support, minimum OS versions
- 🔉 A surprise…

✨ **What's New**

- Reduced CPU usage on the frontend
- Fixed splash screen freeze issue
- Enhanced phone sync for faster Universe Mobile data display
- Reworked wallet event management across Tari Core and Universe frontend - faster win confirmations and instant animations

# 🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.5: The Great Pool War, Episode 1

_February 4, 2025_

Dear Community,

We’ve been building up to this point for many weeks together: today begins the great pool war. Tari Universe v0.9.5 is an important one featuring significant improvements to hash-tiers (low-hash rate miners, ftw!) and the addition of another pool to the Tari world (3 total now: 2 “fast” and 1 “slow”). This release will hopefully improve the overall win frequency for ALL miners on the Tari testnet. A reminder: we define win frequency as the % of miners who earn a reward daily. Our mission is to achieve an 80%+ win frequency during this phase of the Tari testnet

Let the great pool war commence!

## ✨ What's New

🔗 Stabilized multi-pool network connectivity
⚡ Added low-hash tier pool for lower-end miners
🤝 Auto-calibration at startup assigns optimal hash tier
🚀 Improved CPU efficiency via Tari node optimization of cryptographic operations (especially beneficial for lower-power machines)

## 🔜 Coming Soon

⚖️ P2Pool optimization for all power levels
💾 Memory usage stability improvements
⚙️ Persistent window settings restoration
🖥️ Enhanced GPU support, monitoring, and reporting
📝 Automatic release notes pop-up

# 🌟 Tari Universe - Testnet v0.8.52: "Fortunes Favor, Part 2"

_January 27, 2025_

## 📊 What's New

- Fixed p2pool restart problem to improve sync
- Fixed sluggish wallet history performance
- Resolved many memory issues 
- Fixed loading sync stalls at 0%, 30%, and 75% (note: 75% can still take 15+ mins for 5% of miners)
- Streamlined Airdrop login (note: your miner will restart when logging in or out)

## 🔜 What's Next

- Restoring persistent window settings
- Expanded GPU support, monitoring, and reporting
- Optimizing p2pool for computers of all power levels
- Release notes pop-up automatically on every release

## ⚠️ Important Notes

In this sequel to Fortune’s Favor, our champion, Tari Universe, is aiming to beat the 70% 24-hour win rate record that we achieved together in version .44. For higher-power machines (above 1kH/s CPU), the win rate should be closer to 95%+. Contributors are busy implementing hash-tiers, which we hope will improve the win frequency for lower-power miners

# 🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.8.42: "The Shell of Fate, Part 3 (the end of the trilogy!)"

_January 14, 2025_

🔄 Rolling out over the next 24 hours

The Shell of Fate trilogy has been like one of those slow-burning TV series where you must wait patiently for each new season. Thankfully, we got to the end, and the ending here is far better than the end of Game of Thrones. Introducing Shell of Fate, Part 3: the alpha release of squads! In this version of Tari Universe, you will be randomly placed into a pool with a max size of 300 miners. There are no fancy graphics yet to tell you which pool you're in, but the idea is that by capping the # of miners per pool, we hope to create a world where every pool is a lot more stable and reliably produces rewards. Our goal is for 80%+ of Tari miners to earn rewards every single day. We can't wait to see how .42 works for you!

  - During startup
  - During window management
