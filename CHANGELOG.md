🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.90x “RC1” — The Surge of Soon

_April 17, 2025_

Hey fam 👋,

We’re excited to drop the BIGGEST update we’ve ever released 💥

Introducing “The Surge of Soon,” the first release candidate of Tari Universe (v0.9.90). This release of Tari Universe is groundbreaking. One of the most significant sources of feedback contributors receive from the Tari community is related to the startup and initialization of Tari Universe. There are three primary problems with our current startup process:

You can’t access settings, sign into airdrop, or do anything else while the app is starting up
It can take up to 3 hours for a new user to be able to start mining

Many community members aren’t able to load the app at all due to a wide range of errors that occur during the startup process

The Surge of Soon solves these mission-critical issues. You can now access settings ⚙️ and sign into airdrop 🎁 while the app loads. And all Tari Universe users will be able to go from launching the app to mining in 120 seconds or less 🏎️🏁

How does it work? 🧙‍♂️🔧

🔁 When you open the app, Tari Universe now starts immediately mining using a remote node
📡 A newly rewritten sync process runs in the background (check the Connections subtab for progress).
⚡ Once your local node is fully synced, the app automatically switches over to mining using your local node

This remote node setup is a big deal because it allows Tari Universe to fulfill its promise of being the easiest way for anyone to earn crypto and get on-chain. At the same time, Tari miners will still become full nodes for the network, which helps the Tari network from a decentralization and reliability point of view. Local nodes are also more efficient and, therefore, enable better mining performance. 

TL;DR
⏱️ Remote mining gets you started in 120 seconds or less
🏆 Local mining keeps you ahead in the long run

Thank you to everyone in the Tari community for all of your support and for sharing so much great feedback. We are very lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to Tari with you. This release of Tari Universe brings us even closer to our first mainnet release. Tari mainnet, as you may expect, is coming Soon™ 💜🐢

🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.827: The Great Pool Expansion

_March 27, 2025_

Hey Tari Fam 👋,
🚨 IMPORTANT! v0.9.827 is a hard fork of p2pool — meaning you must update to avoid degraded mining performance as other peers upgrade.

🚀 What's new:
- 🔟 Expanded the number of pools to 10
- ⚡ Improved p2pool initialization speed
- 🛠️ Fixed validation logic to eliminate potential forks in edge-case scenarios we uncovered

💡 Note: The Windows binary is now a .exe file for smoother launching that includes installing any missing or outdated dependencies your system may have.

# 🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.805: The Great Pool War, Episode 3

_February 17, 2025_

Dear Community,

As the great pool war enters its 3rd phase, p2pool has maintained its ~80%+ win rate per 24 hours, rising to 90% for those mining for more than six hours. We are (largely) winning fam. Even if you're on the lower end of the hash rate spectrum (e.g., <1000 h/s CPU), each winning share can continue paying out for up to 12 hours—so keep the mining party rolling!

## ✨ What's New

- 🛠 **Resolved app load sequence freezes.**  
- 🎭 **Animation fixes** improved reliability of state transitions.  
- ⚠️ **Airdrop login button failures** traced to unsupported Ubuntu versions and missing OS dependencies.  
  - ✅ **Minimum Ubuntu version: 22**  
  - 📝 We're working on a more robust Linux FAQ since most issues stem from OS flavor/version mismatches. 

## **Coming Soon**

- ⚖️ More P2Pool fixes for lower hash power levels
- ⚙️ Restorationof persistent window settings
- 🖥️ Enhanced GPU support, monitoring, and reporting
- 📋 Roadmap for older OS and GPU support, minimum OS versions
- 🔉 A surprise…

✨ **What's New**

- Reduced CPU usage on the frontend
- Fixed splash screen freeze issue
- Enhanced phone sync for faster Universe Mobile data display
- Reworked wallet event management across Tari Core and Universe frontend - faster win confirmations and instant animations
- Implemented fallbacks if Monero nodes can't be reached (static templates)
- Automated cleanup of temporary Tor files

🔜 **Coming Soon**

# 🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.9.5: The Great Pool War, Episode 1

_February 4, 2025_

Dear Community,

We’ve been building up to this point for many weeks together: today begins the great pool war. Tari Universe v0.9.5 is an important one featuring significant improvements to hash-tiers (low-hash rate miners, ftw!) and the addition of another pool to the Tari world (3 total now: 2 “fast” and 1 “slow”). This release will hopefully improve the overall win frequency for ALL miners on the Tari testnet. A reminder: we define win frequency as the % of miners who earn a reward daily. Our mission is to achieve an 80%+ win frequency during this phase of the Tari testnet

Let the great pool war commence!

## ✨ What's New

🔗 Stabilized multi-pool network connectivity
⚡ Added low-hash tier pool for lower-end miners
🤝 Auto-calibration at startup assigns optimal hash tier
🚀 Improved CPU efficiency via Tari node optimization of cryptographic operations (especially beneficial for lower-power machines)

## 🔜 Coming Soon

⚖️ P2Pool optimization for all power levels
💾 Memory usage stability improvements
⚙️ Persistent window settings restoration
🖥️ Enhanced GPU support, monitoring, and reporting
📝 Automatic release notes pop-up

# 🌟 Tari Universe - Testnet v0.8.52: "Fortunes Favor, Part 2"

_January 27, 2025_

## 📊 What's New

- Fixed p2pool restart problem to improve sync
- Fixed sluggish wallet history performance
- Resolved many memory issues 
- Fixed loading sync stalls at 0%, 30%, and 75% (note: 75% can still take 15+ mins for 5% of miners)
- Streamlined Airdrop login (note: your miner will restart when logging in or out)

## 🔜 What's Next

- Restoring persistent window settings
- Expanded GPU support, monitoring, and reporting
- Optimizing p2pool for computers of all power levels
- Release notes pop-up automatically on every release

## ⚠️ Important Notes

In this sequel to Fortune’s Favor, our champion, Tari Universe, is aiming to beat the 70% 24-hour win rate record that we achieved together in version .44. For higher-power machines (above 1kH/s CPU), the win rate should be closer to 95%+. Contributors are busy implementing hash-tiers, which we hope will improve the win frequency for lower-power miners

# 🌟 TARI UNIVERSE v0.8.42: "The Shell of Fate, Part 3 (the end of the trilogy!)"

_January 14, 2025_

🔄 Rolling out over the next 24 hours

The Shell of Fate trilogy has been like one of those slow-burning TV series where you must wait patiently for each new season. Thankfully, we got to the end, and the ending here is far better than the end of Game of Thrones. Introducing Shell of Fate, Part 3: the alpha release of squads! In this version of Tari Universe, you will be randomly placed into a pool with a max size of 300 miners. There are no fancy graphics yet to tell you which pool you're in, but the idea is that by capping the # of miners per pool, we hope to create a world where every pool is a lot more stable and reliably produces rewards. Our goal is for 80%+ of Tari miners to earn rewards every single day. We can't wait to see how .42 works for you!

## 🛠️ Stability Improvements

Contributors have been hard at work debugging and refactoring to make the app more stable. In today's release:

- 🚀 Resolved app freezing/unresponsiveness:
  - During startup
  - During window management
- 💰 Wallet updates partially fixed:
  - Note: Updates still take extended time

## ⚠️ Upcoming Fixes to Remaining Issues
