🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v1.0.11: The Shell Ascendant

_May 25, 2025_

Hey everyone,
Welcome to Day 19 of Tari mainnet! The "Shell Ascendant" hotfix prepares the network for the hard fork at block 15,000, happening ~ mid-late afternoon on Monday 26th UTC. A reminder of how the Tari network is changing:

Currently, the Tari network hash rate is split as follows:
- 50% RandomX (merge mine with XMR)
- 50% SHA3

After the hard fork, the network hash rate will be split as follows:
- 33% RandomX (merge with XMR)
- 33% RandomX (Tari solo mine)
- 33% SHA3

The goal is to create a new opportunity for Tari-focused miners to earn more rewards. All miners must upgrade their mining client to continue mining after the hard fork. If you don't, you'll be mining air 😛

Hey everyone,
Happy day 9 of Tari mainnet! The “Waves of Resolve” hotfix improves p2pool stability and networking reliability. P2pool ftw! 💜🐢

✨ WHAT’S NEW
- Reduces unnecessary resyncs to the p2pool share chain
- Fixes a bug where large messages in p2pool sent over the network were getting cut off because they were too big, which negatively impacted synching to the tip of the p2pool share chain

🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v1.0.0: A Boundless Paradise

_May 6, 2025_

Hey Everyone,

The day is finally here. After 2,863 days of hard work (!!!), the Tari mainnet is LIVE. Thank you for believing in us. For your passion. Late night bug reports. And brilliant ideas for making Tari Universe even better. Tari exists because of you 💜🐢
The birth of a proof-of-work network is special. In the early days, the network needs time to stabilize and find its rhythm. We call this the “warm-up phase.”

Contributors and early supporters of the Tari network (like exchanges and infrastructure partners) expect the warm-up phase to last about 15 days. After that, the network will transition to a more stable state.
During the warm-up phase, some quirks are normal. You might see block time fluctuations, temporary disconnections, syncing delays, or even short-lived forks that require your node to reconnect to the main chain.
The warm-up phase is a great time to mine because rewards are highest per block. We hope the early days of the Tari network are rewarding for you.

Let the games begin. May the blocks be forever in your favor!
