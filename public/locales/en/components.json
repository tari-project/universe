We call this the \"warm-up phase.\"\nContributors and early supporters of the Tari network (like exchanges and infrastructure partners) expect the warm-up phase to last about 15 days. After that, the network will transition to a more stable state.\nDuring the warm-up phase, some quirks are normal. You might see block time fluctuations, temporary disconnections, syncing delays, or even short-lived forks that require your node to reconnect to the main chain.\nThe warm-up phase is a great time to mine because rewards are highest per block. We hope the early days of the Tari network are rewarding for you.\nLet the games begin. May the blocks be forever in your favor!",
