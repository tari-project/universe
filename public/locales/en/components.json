We call this period the \"warm-up phase.\" Contributors and those who want to support the Tari network (eg. exchanges etc.) expect the Tari warm-up phase to last ~15 days.\nDuring this time, some irregular behavior is expected. You may experience fluctuations in block times, temporary disconnects, or syncing issues. Sometimes, your node might end up on a temporary fork and need to reconnect to the main chain.\nDon't worry, miners are still earning XTM during our warm-up phase! This period allows the system to calibrate as more miners and nodes come online. No action is needed unless your node becomes stuck. Restarting or resyncing will usually resolve it. After the warm-up period, the network will transition to a more stable state.",
